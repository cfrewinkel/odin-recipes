    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (5 oz) pkg baby spinach</li>
        <li>1 ½ lb chicken breasts, boneless skinless</li>
        <li>1 English cucumber</li>
        <li>4 large flour tortillas</li>
        <li>½ (8 oz) block mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>FHolding a knife parallel to the cutting board, cut the chicken in half horizontally to form thin fillets. Pat dry with paper towel and season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>When the grill pan or skillet is hot, drizzle with oil and add fillets. Grill until cooked through, about 3-4 minutes per side. When the chicken is done, set aside on a plate and cover with aluminum foil. Wipe out and reserve pan for use later.</li>
        <li>Wash and dry the cucumber and tomatoes. Cut the tomatoes into wedges and the cucumber into thin, half moons; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add vinegar to a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce to medium-low and continue to simmer, uncovered, until reduced by half, 5-7 minutes; remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine mayonnaise and spices in a small bowl; whisk to combine the ranch dressing.</li>
        <li>Wash and dry spinach. (Skip if it came pre-washed.)</li>
        <li>Lay the tortillas on a flat surface and divide spinach, chicken, grated cheese, and ranch dressing between them. Roll tightly to close.</li>
        <li>Place wraps on the grill and cook, rotating every 1-2 minutes, until tortilla is crispy and golden. Cut each wrap in half.</li>
