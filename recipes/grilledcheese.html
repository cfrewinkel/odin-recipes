<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Grilled cheese fancied up with apple slices. Tomato soup thats better than the can version.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 oz) block cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>16 fl oz chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 (14.5 oz) cans diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 Gala apples</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>8 slices whole grain bread</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and dry the fresh produce.</li>
        <li>Quarter the apples lengthwise, then cut out the core and stem from each section. Cut 2 of the quarters lengthwise into thin wedges and transfer to a small bowl. Medium dice the other 2 quarters and transfer to a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Trim off and discard the ends of the onion and remove the outer layer; small dice the onion (cut into ¼-inch pieces) and add to the bowl with the apples.</li>
        <li>Trim off and discard the root ends of the garlic; peel and mince or press the garlic. Add to the bowl with the apples and onion.</li>
        <li>Once the saucepan is hot, add butter and swirl to coat the bottom.</li>
        <li>Add the apples, onion, and garlic to the saucepan; season with oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the apples and onion are softened, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the diced tomatoes and broth to the saucepan; season with additional salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add butter to a nonstick skillet and heat over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Place the bread slices on a clean, dry work surface. Divide the apple slices and cheese between 4 of the bread slices, then top with the remaining bread slices.</li>
        <li>Once melted, spread the butter around the skillet, then season the bottom of the skillet with salt.</li>
        <li>Place the sandwiches in the skillet and cook until golden brown and crispy on the first side, 3 to 4 minutes. Then, add more butter and salt, and carefully flip the sandwiches; cook until golden brown on the other side and the cheese has melted, 3 to 4 minutes. Once done, transfer to a cutting board. Cook in batches if necessary.</li>
        <li>Using a hand blender, purée the soup until smooth. Alternatively, use a potato masher to mash the tomatoes and apples (the soup will be chunkier).</li>
        <li>Cut the grilled cheese sandwiches in half diagonally.</li>
        <li>To serve, divide the soup between small bowls and serve with the grilled cheese on the side. Enjoy!</li>
